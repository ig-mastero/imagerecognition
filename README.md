Project Topic Discussion: </br>
Our project focuses on recognising Image using tensorflow Libraries. And uses Machine Learning to train the model. And then compare the image with the database it has.
</p>


<h3>How to use the model:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Make a new folder in your computer to store this codes.</li>
<li>Step 2: Run the model_training.py file to train the model. It will create a image_classifier.model folder to store the trained model database data. 
(Note: This step can take a bit time. Depending on the hardware of the machine it will be executed) </li>
<li>Step 3: Finally Run the model_testing.py file to run the code. 
  (remember to change the name of the image as mentioned in the code)</li>
</ul>

Thank you for your time and consideration.
